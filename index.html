        <h1>ABOUT ME </h1>
        <p class=" introduction">
           I am a motivated and passionate student with a strong interest in computer applications and software development.br I have completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from MU University, where I gained a solid foundation in programming concepts, databases, and web technologies. During my academic journey, I developed an interest in building practical solutions using technology.

Currently, I am pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) from MDU, and I am a first-year MCA student. I am actively learning modern tools and technologies and applying them through hands-on projects to improve my technical skills. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I continuously focus on writing clean and efficient code.

My goal is to start my career as a software or web developer, where I can contribute to meaningful projects, grow professionally, and continue learning in a dynamic environment.
